VySol is an accessible local-first graph RAG app built to make ingestion, graph extraction, entity resolution, embeddings, and chat easy to set up and use in one place.

You can ingest plain-text source material, control how the graph is built, resolve duplicate entities after ingestion, review and repair extraction safety blocks in-app, and chat with both chunk retrieval and graph context without leaving the app.

Entity resolution supports a fast `Exact only` cleanup pass or a fuller `Exact + chooser/combiner` workflow after ingestion, plus per-run unique-node embedding batch and delay controls.

Global settings now split into a preset-backed `Configuration` tab and a shared `Key Library`, both backed by a LiteLLM catalog pinned to exact version `1.82.6`. Providers are listed alphabetically, open-ended providers can use custom model ids where appropriate, and embedding settings are provider-aware in both global settings and world re-ingest setup.

## Supported OS

- Windows: Supported (`VySol.bat` launcher)
- macOS/Linux: Manual setup only for now (coming soon)

## What This Project Is

VySol was personally developed for roleplay in pre-existing fictional worlds, but it is designed to be useful anywhere local-first graph RAG is helpful.

It gives you one place to:

- Ingest source text into a world
- Extract entities and relationships into a graph
- Rebuild vectors or fully rebuild ingests when needed
- Resolve duplicate entities after ingestion
- Switch between saved global configuration presets while reusing one shared per-provider credential library
- Repair blocked chunks with the Safety Review Queue and reusable chunk-body overrides
- Chat against chunk retrieval and graph context together
- Trace every graph edge back to its source document and chunk, useful for chronological documents
- Inspect exactly what context was sent for every chat message with Context X-Ray

## Common Uses

- Roleplay in pre-existing fictional worlds
- Anyone who wants easy-to-use, fast-setup local-first graph RAG for their own corpus or workflow
- Original worldbuilding and lore management
- Continuity checking across long-running stories or document sets
- Personal knowledge bases with traceable source grounding
- Studying large document collections with graph-backed chat
- Organizing technical documentation and internal knowledge
- Investigating timelines and connections across archival or reference material
- Inspectable local-first RAG over private text corpora
